# vue-crud-recipes

Create, edit and delete recipes.

> **WARNING**: This is a simple poc using [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) just to test CRUD operations. It contains a very minimalistic implementation of CRUD operations and should not be used as example for real aplications, it relies on the client cooperation for testing the `where` query by not creating two recipes with the same title.
